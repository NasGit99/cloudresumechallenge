<h1>Overview</h1>

The Cloud Resume Challenge project was created so people could showcase their cloud technology skills. In this project, I am hosting a personal resume on a cloud platform. This website integrates multiple cloud services such as Cloudfront, S3, ACM, DynamoDB, API Gateway & Lambda. This project also allows me to demonstrate my knowledge of infrastructure as code, serverless architecture and deployment practices.
